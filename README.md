# Yandex.Music hotkeys workflow for Alfred

This workflow allows to bind hotkeys for common Yandex.Music actions (play/pause, next, previous, like, dislike).

When you're using like hotkey and current track is already liked, the track will stay liked just to be sure that you will not unlike already liked track.

Tested with Alfred 2.5.1, Safari 8.0, OS X Yosemite 10.10.

Note that [Alfred Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) is required to use workflows.
